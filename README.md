**Progress Tracking:**

Highlights:
- Construction of Full Sequence from Base and Modifications:
  
Implemented a method to construct a full sequence by appending modifications at the correct positions in the base sequence within the MsPathFinderTResult class. This ensures accurate representation of the identified proteoforms.

- Creating an Interface for All Result Files:
  
Introduced the IResult interface in the Readers.ExternalResults.BaseClasses namespace. This interface standardizes the structure for result files, defining properties such as OneBasedScanNumber, BaseSequence, FullSequence, Accession, IsDecoy, Modifications, Charge, and Mass.

- Creating a Method to Make a List of Said Interface in Each Class of Consensus Dataset:
  
Added methods in the HolyDatasetMST class to convert result files into a list of IResult interface implementations. This allows for unified handling and processing of different types of results across the consensus dataset.

- Creating a Unified Search Engine Handling System with Handler in Consensus Dataset:
  
Introduced the Handler class in the Readers.ConsensusDataset namespace. This class manages different subclasses such as HolyDatasetMM, HolyDatasetMST, and HolyDatasetTopPIC. It includes methods to find executable paths and initialize these subclasses, providing a unified system for handling various search engines.
